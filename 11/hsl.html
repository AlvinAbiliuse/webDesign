		<h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
		<p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes 
			dissolved materials from the Earth's crust as well as 
			materials released from organisms. The most important
			components of seawater that influence life forms are
			salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and
			carbon dioxide), nutrients and pH. These elements vary in
			their compossition as well as their influence on marine
			life.</p>
