				includes dissolved materials from the Earth's crust as 
				well as materials released from organisms. The most 
				important components of seawater that influence life 
				forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly
				oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients and pH. These 
				elements vary in their compossition as well as their 
				influence on marine life.</p></div>
